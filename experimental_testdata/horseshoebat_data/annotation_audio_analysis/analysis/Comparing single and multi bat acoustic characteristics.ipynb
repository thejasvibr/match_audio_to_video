    "This notebook will deal with the resampling and comparison of single and multi bat context audio segments. \n",

    "### Observed audio split-measurements\n",
    "Each video annotation was matched with a corresponding length of audio, and each annotation also had the number of bats seen in the video. In the previous notebook ('Split measuring all valid...'), each annotation audio was split into 50ms segments and various measurements were carried out on them (rms, -20dB frequency, dominant frequency). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Virtual multi-bat audio split-measurements\n",
    "The same protocol for the observed audio split-measurements was followed to keep the measurements comparable. The main difference if that the audio analysed here were actually synthetic. The 'virtual' multi bat audio were made by adding two or three duration matched single bat files. This mimics a situation where two bats are echolocating in the recording volume, without showing any response to each other. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reducing the extent of pseudo-replication in the natural observations through bootstrapping\n",
    "\n",
    "In the current notebook I will now load the previous measurements of segments that had a non-negligible rms (+20dB above the level calculated for silent audio segments). These measurements contain measurement values for multiple segments from the same audio file. Comparing the measurements from all segments together may lead to spurious results because of the extent of pseudo-replication in the data. This is because, not only are the segments from the same audio file, but even many of the audio files are from the same hour. \n",
    "\n",
    "Resampling to take out the measurements from one segment per audio file will help reduce the extent of pseudo-replication. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparisons to be performed\n",
    "*Update (2020-08-25): in a previous version of this notebook I had calculated $\\Delta$median differences between the 3 pairs derived from the three 'groups' we have. After discussion with NMR and HRG, we decided the $\\Delta$median is not the most biologically relevant way to present all the data. Different parameters need to be tested with different methods as is relevant. More importantly, it was also decided that it's better to first study the bootstrapped median values before jumping into the $\\Delta$median values*\n",
    "\n",
    "The bootstrapped median values will be calculated for all parameters across all groups. A single window will be chosen from each annotation matched audio file and this will be used to generate the median value. The median value is sensible to compare for certain parameters eg. peak amplitude, rms, lower frequency. For other parameters it is less relevant, eg. dominant frequencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "For parameters like dominant frequencies, the more relevant question is whether the frequency distributions overlap or not. It is not so much of interest whether the overall median is higher or lower, but rather whether the overall dominant frequency distributions are similar. The question is more holistically focussed. \n"
